## Overview

This package contains _infrastructure_ to create and manage values of tuning parameters for the tidymodels packages. If you are looking for _how to_ tune parameters in tidymodels, please look at the [tune](https://tune.tidymodels.org/) package and [tidymodels.org](https://www.tidymodels.org/). 

The name reflects the idea that tuning predictive models can be like turning a set of dials on a complex machine under duress.
