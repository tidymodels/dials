grid_regular(x, ..., levels = 3, original = TRUE, filter = NULL)

\method{grid_regular}{parameters}(x, ..., levels = 3, original = TRUE, filter = NULL)

\method{grid_regular}{list}(x, ..., levels = 3, original = TRUE, filter = NULL)

grid_random(x, ..., size = 5, original = TRUE, filter = NULL)

\method{grid_random}{parameters}(x, ..., size = 5, original = TRUE, filter = NULL)

\method{grid_random}{list}(x, ..., size = 5, original = TRUE, filter = NULL)

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{param} object, list, or \code{parameters}.}

\item{...}{One or more \code{param} objects (such as \code{\link[=mtry]{mtry()}} or
\code{\link[=penalty]{penalty()}}). None of the objects can have \code{unknown()} values in
the parameter ranges or values.}

\item{levels}{An integer for the number of values of each parameter to use
to make the regular grid. \code{levels} can be a single integer or a vector of
integers that is the same length as the number of parameters in \code{...}.}

\item{original}{A logical: should the parameters be in the original units or
in the transformed space (if any)?}

\item{filter}{A logical: should the parameters be filtered prior to
generating the grid. Must be a single expression referencing parameter
names that evaluates to a logical vector.}

\item{size}{A single integer for the total number of parameter value
combinations returned for the random grid.}
}
\value{
A tibble with an additional class for the type of grid
(\code{"grid_regular"} or \code{"grid_random"}). There are columns for
each parameter and a row for every parameter combination.
}
\description{
Random and regular grids can be created for any number of parameter objects.
}
\examples{
# filter arg will allow you to filter subsequent grid data frame based on some condition.
p <- parameters(penalty(), mixture())
grid_regular(p)
grid_regular(p, filter = penalty <= .01)

# Will fail due to unknowns:
# grid_regular(mtry(), min_n())

grid_regular(penalty(), mixture())
grid_regular(penalty(), mixture(), levels = c(3, 4))
grid_random(penalty(), mixture())
