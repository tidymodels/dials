\title{dials: Tools for working with tuning parameters}
\description{
\code{dials} provides a framework for defining, creating, and
managing tuning parameters for modeling. It contains functions
to create tuning parameter objects (e.g. \code{mtry()} or
\code{penalty()}) and others for creating tuning grids (e.g.
\code{grid_regular()}). There are also functions for generating
random values or specifying a transformation of the parameters.
}
\examples{

# Suppose we were tuning a linear regression model that was fit with glmnet
# and there was a predictor that used a spline basis function to enable a
# nonlinear fit. We can use `penalty()` and `mixture()` for the glmnet parts
# and `deg_free()` for the spline.

# A full 3^3 factorial design where the regularization parameter is on
# the log scale:
simple_set <- grid_regular(penalty(), mixture(), deg_free(), levels = 3)
simple_set

# A random grid of 5 combinations
set.seed(362)
random_set <- grid_random(penalty(), mixture(), deg_free(), size = 5)
random_set

# A small space-filling design based on experimental design methods:
design_set <- grid_max_entropy(penalty(), mixture(), deg_free(), size = 5)
design_set
