# dials

## Overview

This package contains *infrastructure* to create and manage values of
tuning parameters for the tidymodels packages. If you are looking for
*how to* tune parameters in tidymodels, please look at the
[tune](https://tune.tidymodels.org/) package and
[tidymodels.org](https://www.tidymodels.org/).

The name reflects the idea that tuning predictive models can be like
turning a set of dials on a complex machine under duress.
